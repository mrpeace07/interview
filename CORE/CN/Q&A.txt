Subnetting involves dividing a network into smaller segments using subnet masks to identify the network and host portions of IP addresses. 

 

Interviewer: Explain Firewalls. 

Student: 

Firewalls are network security devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as barriers between trusted internal networks (e.g., LAN) and untrusted external networks (e.g., the internet), filtering traffic to prevent unauthorized access and protect against threats. 

 

Interviewer: Different types of delays. 

Student: 

Propagation Delay: The time taken for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver through the medium (e.g., cables, fiber optics). 

Transmission Delay: The time taken to push all the bits of a packet into the link. 

Processing Delay: The time taken by the router or a switch to process the packet. 

Queueing Delay: The time spent waiting in a queue to be transmitted onto the link. 

 

Interviewer: Explain 3-way handshaking. 

Student: 

3-way handshaking is a process used in TCP/IP communication to establish a reliable connection between two devices (client and server). It involves three steps: 

SYN (Synchronize): The client sends a SYN packet to the server to initiate a connection request. 

SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client's request and signaling readiness to establish a connection. 

ACK (Acknowledge): The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, confirming receipt of the SYN-ACK packet and completing the connection establishment process. 

 

Interviewer: What is a server-side load balancer? 

Student: 

A server-side load balancer is a hardware or software-based device that distributes incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers or resources in a server farm or data center. It helps optimize resource utilization, improve responsiveness, and ensure high availability by evenly distributing workload among servers based on predefined algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections). 

 

Interviewer: Explain the RSA Algorithm. 

Student: 

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission and digital signatures. It involves the use of two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. 

 

Interviewer: What is HTTP and HTTPS protocol? 

Student: 

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web servers and clients (browsers).

Interviewer: What is SMTP protocol? 

Student: 

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): SMTP is a protocol used for sending and receiving email messages between servers. It defines how email messages are relayed and delivered over the internet. SMTP servers handle outgoing mail (from sender to receiver) and use other protocols like POP3 or IMAP for incoming mail retrieval. 

 

Interviewer: TCP and UDP protocol, prepare differences. 

Student: 

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets between applications. It ensures data integrity through acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms, making it suitable for applications that require reliable transmission (e.g., web browsing, file transfer). 

UDP (User Datagram Protocol): UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers minimal overhead and does not guarantee delivery or error-checking of data packets. It is used for applications where speed and efficiency are prioritized over reliability, such as real-time multimedia streaming, online gaming, and DNS. 

 

Interviewer: What happens when you enter “google.com” (very very famous question)? 

Student: 

When you enter "google.com" in a web browser: 

The browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server to resolve "google.com" into an IP address. 

The DNS server responds with the IP address of Google's servers (e.g., 172.217.6.46). 

The browser establishes a TCP connection to the server at the resolved IP address on port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS). 

The browser sends an HTTP request for the webpage associated with "google.com". 

The server responds with the requested webpage, which the browser then renders and displays to the user. 

 

Interviewer: Hub vs Switch. 

Student: 

Hub: A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices in a network, operating at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. It broadcasts data to all connected devices, causing collisions and limiting network performance and security. 

Switch: A switch is an intelligent networking device that operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It forwards data only to the intended recipient device based on MAC addresses, improving network efficiency by reducing collisions and providing better security and bandwidth management compared to hubs.
